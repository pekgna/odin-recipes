    <h1>Dirty Martini</h1>
    <img src="../images/martini.jpg">
    <p>The Martini is as classic as cocktails get. Everybody knows it, most people have had one, and any good bar worth its salt can make one. But not all Martinis are the same.</p>
    <p>The cocktail can be made with gin or vodka. Gin is the classic choice, but by the 1970s, vodka had supplanted its botanical cousin, and it became the regular call in Dirty Martinis. You can choose whichever spirit you prefer, as both do an admirable job.</p>
