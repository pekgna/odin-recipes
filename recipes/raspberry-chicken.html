    <h1>Raspberry Chicken</h1>
    <img src="../images/chicken.jpg">
    <p>This raspberry chicken recipe makes a tasty meal with hot cooked rice or a small pasta, such as orzo or ditalini. Or serve the chicken with another grain, like farro, quinoa, or couscous. Add cooked spinach or broccoli for a fabulous meal. Or slice the cooked chicken and arrange it on fresh spinach leaves with thinly sliced red onions. Drizzle some of the sauce over the chicken.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>3 ounces balsamic vinaigrette, purchased or homemade</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh red raspberries</li>
        <li>1/4 cup raspberry jam</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sherry vinegar, or red wine vinegar, or white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried tarragon, crumbled</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put chicken breast halves between sheets of plastic wrap; gently pound to flatten to an even thickness. If the chicken breasts are large, slice them in half horizontally to make cutlets.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with salt and pepper; drizzle or brush with balsamic vinaigrette. Cover and refrigerate.</li>
        <li>Clean the raspberries and put a few aside for garnish. In a saucepan, combine berries, jam, vinegar, tarragon, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Let cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Spoon about 2 to 3 tablespoons of the sauce into a bowl, then strain the remaining raspberry sauce through a fine mesh strainer into the same bowl. Keep warm or refrigerate the sauce and warm it up when ready to serve.</li>
        <li>Grill chicken pieces over medium coals for about 3 minutes on each side, or until cooked through. Alternatively, pan grill or broil the chicken breasts.</li>
        <li>Arrange the chicken on a platter or individual plates. Spoon raspberry sauce over the chicken pieces and garnish with some fresh berries, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
